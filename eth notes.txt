                          ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN

             -decentralized
             -distributed digital ledger
             -secure and transparent
             -system designed to verify and record transactions in a trustless manner
    (at core it behaves like other blockchains but its focus is on Smart Contracts and decentralized applications more)
              It is a programmable technology that allows DAPPs and DAOs.
              Introduced by VITALIK BUTREIN in 2015.
              Its native currency is ETHER.

    KEY FEATURES=
             -Decentralization
             -Transparency
             -Security
             -interoperability

    USE CASES=
            - DE-FI = smart contracts for lending crypto, borrowing and trading.
            -NFTs   = Digital ownership of art, collectables etc.
            -Gaming Industry= in game assets and decentralized marketplace.

    Ethereum MAINNET=
            -primary public ethereum production blockchain. 
            -Actual deployment and actual transactions happen here.
            -etherscan.io is where you can see live transactions.

    Ethereum TESTNET=
            -before actually deploying smart contracts and DAPPs on mainnet, we need to test tem. testnets are places where testing happens.
            -different type of public testnets.
                      -goeli
                      -sepolia and many other.
    
    MERKLE TREE=
            -Leaf node is the hash of data block and each non-leaf block node is a hash of its child node.
            -used to verify the integrity of large amount of data.
            -it is a data structure organizing the transactions.
            -we can trace to the root of transaction.
            -Secure as it is very difficult to alter the data without invading the hash of root node.

    ACCOUNTS=
            -EOA
            -CONTRACT ACCOUNTS
    WALLETS=
            Ethereum wallets are tools (software or hardware) that let users store, send, and receive ETH and interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

        Types of wallets:

              -Software wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet): Easy to use and ideal for regular transactions.

              -Hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor): Physical devices offering high security.

            -Web wallets (e.g., Coinbase Wallet): Accessible via browsers; convenient but less secure.

    TRANSACTIONS=
                An Ethereum transaction is a cryptographically signed instruction from an account, used to:

                 -Send ETH

                 -Deploy or interact with smart contracts

                 -Transfer tokens (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.)

    EIPs=
        Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are design documents that propose new features or changes to the Ethereum protocol.


ETHEREUM NODES=
        -Fundamental components.
        -it is a computer or device that runs Ethereum client software and connects to the Ethereum network. These nodes help maintain the decentralized and secure nature of the blockchain by sharing, verifying, and storing data.

TYPES= 
      1- Full Node=
                -Stores the entire Ethereum blockchain (all blocks and transactions).
                -Verifies all transactions and smart contract states.
                -Keeps the network secure and trustworthy.
                Example clients: Geth, Nethermind, Besu (running in full mode)

      2-Light Node (Light Client)
                -Downloads only block headers, not full transaction data.
                -Verifies transactions using help from full nodes.
                -Uses less storage and computing power.
                -Used in mobile wallets and devices with limited resources.

      3-Archive Node=
               -Like a full node but also stores all historical state data.
               -Allows access to any past state at any block â€” useful for research, analytics, and dApps.
               -Consumes a huge amount of storage (terabytes).



    ETEREUM CLIENTS=
                  Ethereum clients are software implementations of the Ethereum protocol. They let you run a node, interact with the network, and validate transactions/blocks.

        TYPES=
             -execution clients (Execution Clients handle transaction processing and smart contract execution (EVM).)

             -consensus clients (Consensus Clients manage block validation and consensus rules (especially for Proof of Stake))

        | Client Name    | Programming Language       | Type             |
        | -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- |
        | **Geth**       | Go                         | Execution Client |
        | **Nethermind** | C#                         | Execution Client |
        | **Besu**       | Java                       | Execution Client |
        | **Erigon**     | Go (performance-optimized) | Execution Client |
        | **Prysm**      | Go                         | Consensus Client |
        | **Lighthouse** | Rust                       | Consensus Client |
        | **Teku**       | Java                       | Consensus Client |
        | **Nimbus**     | Nim                        | Consensus Client |

     IN SIMPLE TERMS= 
                       Client = Software
                       Node = Computer running the software
