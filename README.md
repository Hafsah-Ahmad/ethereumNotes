Ethereum Blockchain Overview
Ethereum is a decentralized, distributed digital ledger that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Introduced by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, it uses Ether (ETH) as its native currency.

Key Features=
-Decentralization
-Transparency
-Security
-Interoperability

Common Use Cases=
DeFi: Lending, borrowing, trading crypto
NFTs: Digital ownership of art and collectibles
Gaming: In-game assets and decentralized marketplaces

Networks=
Mainnet: Live Ethereum blockchain for real transactions (Etherscan)
Testnets: Testing environments like Goerli and Sepolia

Core Concepts=
Merkle Tree: Data structure ensuring transaction integrity
Accounts: Externally Owned and Contract Accounts
Wallets: Software (MetaMask), Hardware (Ledger), Web wallets (Coinbase Wallet)
Transactions: Sending ETH, interacting with contracts, token transfers
EIPs: Proposals for network upgrades


Ethereum Nodes=
A node is a device running Ethereum client software to connect with the network.
Nodes help store, verify, and propagate blockchain data.
Types:
-Full Node: Stores the full blockchain and verifies all transactions.
Examples: Geth, Besu, Nethermind
-Light Node: Downloads only block headers; uses less storage.
Used in mobile wallets.
-Archive Node: Stores full history; useful for analytics.
Requires large storage (terabytes).

Ethereum Clients=
Clients are software that implement Ethereum protocols.
They let you run a node and interact with the network.
Types:
-Execution Clients: Handle transactions and run smart contracts.
-Consensus Clients: Manage block validation and consensus (PoS).

Node vs Client=
              -Client = Software
              -Node = Computer running the software
              hello guys , love you so much..
